What have I been up to? And [what is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Personally

Lately I'm playing guitar (poorly), catching up on anime, and playing games. I try to exercise daily as well to try to balance the fantastic vegan baked goods that my husband makes. Recently bought a sewing machine because I had a big patch to sew to my jacket- might have to take up quilting now that it's here.

## Professionally

Building TONS of websites for [160over90](https://160over90.com)- at least a dozen since I started there in May 2017. I also help assess web projects built across the 160over90 digital teams for accessibility. Doing a little bit of web design when the creative team is strained. Working from home for the foreseeable future.

## My Favorite Things

These are some things that have brought joy recently:

* I have a big collection of mechanical keyboards but my daily driver at home has been my [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/). I'm counting down until I get to outfit it with a set of dark [Magical Girl keycaps](https://thekey.company/products/dsa-magic-girl-keycaps-round-2).
* I love [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for taking notes and managing personal projects. My notes are all private by default but can easily be made public and shared to collaborators via a link.
* The [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) color theme. If I can swap a color theme of a tool or application for this one, I've done it. Considering paying for the Pro theme.
* The new [Binding Of Isaac: Repentance DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/). I've sunk an embarrassing amount of time into this game and a lot of free time lately is spent trying to overcome the new content. Loved this game through every iteration, 10/10.
* The [Apple Fitness+ app](https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/). I'm trying to become more active but doing unstructured workouts on my own is not effective for me and can become boring pretty quickly. I can pick a workout that suits me no based on how I feel and what equipment I have available and there is always new content to choose from. Since I'm enrolled in the iOS beta I've been able to AirPlay to my TV-- a huge bonus.
