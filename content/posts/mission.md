I'm at the [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com) conference in Chicago, having a great time and learning a lot. I started this personal site rebuild after being inspired by some of the talks the past two days. It's my goal to learn more about these and put them to use on this site:

* Add a service worker
* Design with a variable font
* Try out CSS variables
* Attempt to build and then actually use a design system
* Build and test for accessibility

Excited to test things out, it's way past due.
