Early this year the team was presented with the opportunity to work with Maha, a new organic hard seltzer brand from Anheuser Busch. It's a new brand so it was an exciting challenge to help establish their voice from the beginning.

I was the dev assigned to this project as well, there's nothing wild going on in the front end to report on but it was another project that had to be turned around right away.
