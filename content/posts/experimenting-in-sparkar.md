Earlier this year there was a little dip in work so I had the chance to play with Spark AR.

The first that I did was an easy Sailor Moon inspired filter that attached some 2d decorations to any face in frame. Learned quite a bit with this and got a feel for the Spark AR software. I was also able to experience the submission process and it's live as an Instagram filter now!

My second filter was one to duplicate the duotone filters used in a lot of the 160 over 90 graphics! You can tap to cycle through different color filters. This one was fun and gave me a chance to dive into the patch editor since it requires some functionality in order to cycle through the different colors.
